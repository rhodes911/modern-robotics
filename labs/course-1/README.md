# Course 1 – Foundations of Robot Motion

Suggested artifacts:
- Week 1: Configuration spaces (C-spaces), coordinate representations
- Week 2: Rotations (SO(3)), angular velocities (so(3))
- Week 3: Rigid motions (SE(3)), twists/wrenches
- Week 4: PoE formulation and transformation adjoints

For coding, implement pieces under `src/robotics/math` and `src/robotics/kinematics`.
Add small Python scripts or notebooks per week as you prefer.
